    "### First a few data notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### At this point it is a little tricky to follow what Dexter has done, that we have also done, or, do not want to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First, Dexter omitted three populations, RWI, CDR and VES for various reasons, but I repaired all these except VES, which is a population where I still need to trace down the X/Y coords. Still, I have not deleted the VES plants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Second, Dexter and I made much the same decisions about missing values and obvious corrections to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Third, for size related traits, Dexter divided the sums across censuses (e.g. number of leaves) by the longevity of the plant. This gives a sort of average phenotype for an average census, but it strikes me that all those traits are now correlated wtih longevity in some way and therefore each other. So let's not do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finally, Dexter used PCA on neutral markers and environmental variables, then used ANOVA to get the residuals of the traits. He then analyzed were the residuals from this ANOVA for continent effects etc., thus trying to remove effects the environment, gender, neutral markers etc. I have some issues with this because some of the differences between continents for example may be environmental and we would be removing effects on phenotype that we would like to study. Anyway, here is the flow of all that."
