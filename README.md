# Silene-Invasive-Data

This repository is for those that would like to access our experiments on the invasiveness of Silene latifolia during its invasion into North America. If you would like to collaborate, or notice errors or omissions, please contact Doug Taylor at drt3b@virginia.edu.

Briefly, ~30 full sib families originating in Europe and ~30 full sib families originating in North America were planted in 4 common gardens, two in Europe and two in North America. So it is essentially a reciprocal transplant experiment. There are a lot of details of the experimental design that motivate the analyses below.

The raw data are located in the CSV, "2021 Common Garden Data Working Copy.csv"

Another data set summarizes molecular data and includes the deme assignments of the full sib families using the program Structure.

The results of the Structure analysis are in the CSV, "Structure_assignments.csv"

The script, "Parse Invasives Data,py" cleans up and merges these two data sets, resulting in "raw garden data with deme assignments.csv"

We are early in the analysis of these data and will update these resources.
